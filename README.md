## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a PhD student at New Jersey Institute of Technology, happy to work under the supervise of Prof. Amy K. Hoover.
I am "on the pipeline" to find an optimization algorithm that facilitate the co-evolving process of problem and solution population at the same time (or iterative).

Have a good day!
